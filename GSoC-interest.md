# Google Summer of Code Interested Candidates

Hi potential GSoC students,

A few details regarding the application process specific to the CHAOSS project:

1) You must complete one micro-task related to the idea you are interested on. You can find the micro-tasks on the GSoc Idea Page at: https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/chaoss/gsoc-ideas

2) Once you've completed one micro-task, create a pull request on this file below to add yourself, your information, and a link to your repository of the completed micro-task.

You must complete these two things by March 27 16:00 UTC.

Regards,
GSoC Mentors
